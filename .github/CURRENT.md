About current wealthbot

Webo is a robo-advisor and not fully advisor so you need to do some paperwork. you can see more info in my medium blog 
Webo automatically calculates client’s portfolio, then advisor approves it

With the current installation

you can fill info, for example customise one of advisors. and clients and show to your potential clients, so you can have paying clients to improve Webo later.
